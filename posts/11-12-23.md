[%title%]About Me

This is something that will go on its own page once I have routing set up on this site. 
In the mean time I'm writing this to see how github fares as a post editor (this is my second time writing this so.. not great)

My name is Ethan Halko (probably evident given the URL). I'm ($currentYear - 1989$) years old. As a career I have chosen web/software development and so far I am extremely grateful for the relatively impulsive decision I made 13-ish years ago (this number hurts me emotionally). I've been in the industry for about 10 years if you include co-op semesters. 

I'm a big fan of making things. It is my *raison d'etre*, if you will. If I'm not working on personal software projects (something I have slacked on for many years) I'm likely designing something to 3D print, building a guitar pedal or a synth module, baking a loaf of artisan bread or (a recent addition to my hobby collection) sewing. I might also be on a bike ride or at the record store or playing a video game or reading (fiction, non-fiction, whatever - the weirder the better). 

I have a dog (Ã‰lodie, named after the [Casiotone For The Painfully Alone song lyric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNB30UnOiBA)) and a cat (Rutabaga, named after the root vegetable..). Rutabaga is my day-one and is approaching 13 years old with the 'tude to match. El is afraid of everything.
