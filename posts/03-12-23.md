[title]What I'm Doing Right Now

Alright so here's a blog? I figure it's about time to have my personal domain actually go somewhere. 

This is mostly an excuse to learn React and I suppose to serve as motivation to finish the inifite number of projects 
I currently have on the go (famous last words - if you're reading this an it's the only post on the site, I have failed..) 

In an attempt to avoid this blog being on that list I decided to whip together a "serverless" 
implementation of an almost "featureless" CMS. When I say "serverless" I don't mean "server-side code runs elsewhere",
I mean "there is no server-side code". Posts are stored in the repo as markdown files and then a bundler converts them to 
paginated JSON files when the site builds. I have no idea if this is going to scale, and I have no idea how I'll be serving 
non-text assets yet but that's the fun part, right? 

That's all.     
Feel free to reach out if you want to sell me on a c r y p t o  s c a m or whatever.
