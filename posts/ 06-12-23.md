[%title%] Adding tokens

Realizing I may want to align text in certain ways and that markdown doesn't support this, I have implemented a token 
system for styling sections of posts. The system sort of already existed, as placing:

```
\[%title%\] Title Goes Here
```

On a single line in a post will add a title to a post. I extended [marked.js](https://marked.js.org "marked.js")'s renderer to find other 
tokens at the top of individual paragraphs to set Tailwind classes that can be defined in a `blog.config.ts` file places at
the project root. The syntax is:

```
\[%token:value%\], eg. [%text-align:right%]
```

[%text-align:center%]
This lets you justify text

[%width:24%][%align:ml%]
Or set a specific width and align the paragraph

Adding tokens is easy (I think..). This is what the config object looks like: 

```
  classTokens: {
    'text-align': 'text-%',
    'width': 'w-%',
    'align': '%-auto',
    'font-size': 'text-%'
  }
```

Where the key is the token to be used and the value is a Tailwind class with a `%` placeholder for the resolved value. 
Tailwind knowledge is required at the moment, something like `%-auto` is not user friendly and assumes you know
that `ml-auto` will resolve to `margin-left: auto` and align the object to the far right of its container.
